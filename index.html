                            Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success across several fields, but
                            their proficiency in understanding and resolving complex graph problems is less explored. To
                            bridge this gap, we introduce GraphInstruct, a novel and comprehensive instruction-tuning
                            dataset designed to equip language models with the ability to tackle a broad spectrum of
                            graph problems using explicit reasoning paths.
                            Utilizing GraphInstruct, we build <b>GraphWiz</b>, an open-source language model capable of
                            resolving various graph problem types while generating clear reasoning processes. To enhance
                            the model's capability and reliability, we incorporate the Direct Preference Optimization
                            (DPO) framework into the graph problem-solving context. The enhanced model, GraphWiz-DPO,
                            achieves an average accuracy of 65% across nine tasks with different complexity levels,
                            surpassing GPT-4 which has an average accuracy of 43.8%.
                            Moreover, our research delves into the delicate balance between training data volume and
                            model performance, highlighting the potential for overfitting with increased data.
                            We also explore the transferability of the model's reasoning ability across different graph
                            tasks, indicating the model's adaptability and practical application potential.
                            Our investigation offers a new blueprint and valuable insights for developing LLMs
                            specialized in graph reasoning and problem-solving.

                                While the intersection of graphs and LLMs is an emerging field, it remains uncertain
                                <b>to

                                tasks, such as node classification and link prediction, primarily require LLMs to focus
                                on the
                                semantic aspects of graphs.
                                This often entails a basic understanding of local subgraph structures. Although
                                benchmarks like
                                mathematical problem-solving and
                                knowledge-oriented question-answering necessitate multi-hop
                                reasoning within a graph, they do not always demand an in-depth understanding of the

                                graph's structure. To address this, newer benchmarks like GraphQA and
                                NLGraph have introduced more diverse and complex graph problems to LLMs,
                                demanding a more profound grasp of graph structures---challenges typically addressed by

                                across different levels of computational complexity, showcasing the breadth and depth of
                                our study. We include four of linear complexity tasks: <b>Connectivity</b> and
                                <b>Cycle Detection</b>, <b>Bipartite Graph Checking</b>, and <b>Topological
                                    Sort</b>; three of polynomial complexity tasks: <b>Shortest Path</b>, <b>Maximum

                                directed or undirected and if their edges carry weights. We use the ErdÅ‘s-RÃ©nyi

                            Based on the GraphInstruct dataset, we build GraphWiz, which is developed to
                            optimize current LLMs' capabilities in solving graph problems with explicit reasoning paths.
                            Our training methodology for GraphWiz is a novel two-phase process that first hones the
                            model's ability to interpret and solve a wide range of graph problems using
                            <b><i>Mixed-Task Instruction Tuning</i></b>. The subsequent phase, <b><i>DPO
                                    Alignment</i></b>, further
                            sharpens the model's reasoning by training it to distinguish between more and less effective
                            problem-solving paths. This innovative approach, particularly the use of DPO in the realm of
                            graph problems, represents a pioneering step in teaching LLMs not just to output explicit
                            answers, but to develop and follow a logical reasoning process that mimics expert
                            problem-solving behavior.

                            In this component, we present a case study of a complex cycle detection problem that
                            involves an undirected graph with <b>89 nodes</b> in Figure 4, a scale that
                            poses substantial challenges even for human solvers. For a human to detect a cycle in such
                            an extensive graph would require external aids or substantial time, as it is impractical to
                            resolve purely through mental computation. We could observe that GPT-4 outputs a very short
                            incorrect answer, which could arise from the model's constraints in processing long inputs
                            or from an erroneous interpretation of the graph's intricate structure. This limitation
                            reflects the challenges that conventional LLMs encounter when adapting to graph-theoretic
                            problems. In contrast, GrphWiz correctly detects a cycle, providing a clear and detailed
                            reasoning path. This demonstration of GrphWiz's spatial reasoning and memory retention
                            capabilities is significant. It indicates that the model has effectively internalized the
                            principles of graph theory to the extent that it can autonomously navigate through and
                            reason about large-scale and complex graph structures. This case study is a testament to the
                            feasibility of employing GraphWiz for sophisticated graph problems.
                            The model's ability to accurately resolve such complex tasks suggests it has substantial
                            practical applications, offering a robust tool for researchers and practitioners.
